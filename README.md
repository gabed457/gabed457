## 👨‍💻 Gabriel Driggs  
I design enterprise-grade backend systems focused on **performance**, **resilience**, and **developer experience**. From fault-tolerant pipelines to event-driven microservices, my work is built to scale — and to vanish under load.

- 🛠 **Focus:** TypeScript · Node.js · Fastify · Azure · CosmosDB  
- 💡 **Philosophy:** Speed is a feature · Infrastructure should be invisible · Clarity beats cleverness  
- 🔭 **Exploring:** Event streaming · AI search · Distributed tracing

## 🔎 Public Highlights

Though most of my work lives in private repos, here are public bits that reflect my approach:

- **`nestjs-event-starter`** – Scalable event-driven API template with built‑in tracing & validations  
- **`cosmos-utils`** – Typed CosmosDB helper library for production-grade queries  
- **`gh-oidc-deploy`** – GitHub Action template automating secure deployments via OIDC + semantic versioning  
- **`infra-snippets`** – Terraform and Azure infra configs battle-tested in high-load environments

## 🧭 Architecture Philosophy

> “The best architecture is the one you don’t notice —  
> it scales silently, recovers gracefully, and empowers teams to move fast.”

Constant focus on **observability by default**, **fail-safe design**, and **systems that compound over time**.

- Opens with a **live-like terminal monitor** to draw attention and set a tone.
- Removes **GitHub stats** to avoid highlighting low activity, per research on clean profile design :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- **Emphasizes your values and impact metrics**, replicating your personal site’s feel.
- Shares **public project highlights** to hint at your production-level thinking.
- Ends with a clear **architecture philosophy** and a creative, terminal-based contact snippet for style and approachability.
